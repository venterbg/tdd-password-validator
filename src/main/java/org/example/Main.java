        //A valid password should meet the following requirements:
        //Have more than 8 characters
        //Contains a capital letter
        //Contains a lowercase
        //Contains a number
        //Contains an underscore
        //Technical requirements:
        //We want a method that answers if the password is valid or not.
        //We don't want to know the reason when the password is invalid (the return value is a boolean)
